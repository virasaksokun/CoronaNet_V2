            The CoronaNet project is an international effort of more than 500 researchers to collect data on a variety of government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic for use by policy makers, academic researchers and others. The principal investigators for this project are: <br><br>

            Joan Barceló, New York University Abu Dhabi<br>

            Cindy Cheng, Hochschule für Politik at the Technical University of Munich<br>

            Allison Spencer Hartnett, Yale University<br>

            Robert Kubinec, New York University Abu Dhabi<br>

            Luca Messerschmidt, Hochschule für Politik at the Technical University of Munich<br><br>

            This project has already collected initial data on government responses for all countries in the world. Because of the nature of the global pandemic, we are immediately sharing all data collected in this project with the aim of informing the broader public and stimulating research on the effects and causes of COVID-19 policies. It is an excellent opportunity for those who want hands-on policy analysis. Research assistants also have the option of writing policy reports for their countries or interesting policy trends, which are then published on our website. Your name and bio will also appear in our published articles and on our website.<br><br></p>
